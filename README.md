**QuantumLeap AI Trader** is a full-stack, enterprise-ready application designed to provide a comprehensive and robust platform for algorithmic cryptocurrency trading. It combines a powerful **FastAPI backend** with a sleek, responsive **React frontend** and a companion **React Native mobile app**, offering a seamless experience from strategy creation to live deployment.

This project was architected not just as a tool, but as a production-grade showcase of modern software development, integrating everything from real-time data streams and ML models to secure payments, custodial wallet management, and community-driven features.

## üöÄ The QuantumLeap Edge: Why This Platform Excels

*   **Intelligence over Automation:** Goes beyond simple bots. With **Optimus AI Mode**, the platform uses a pre-trained XGBoost model to vet trading signals against broader market conditions, preventing bad entries in volatile markets.
*   **Democratized Strategy Creation:** The **Visual Strategy Builder** provides a no-code, drag-and-drop interface, empowering non-technical traders to build, backtest, and deploy complex strategies with ease.
*   **Professional-Grade Risk & Analytics:** Control capital with advanced position sizing models (Fixed Fractional, ATR Volatility) and gain deep insights with a dedicated analytics suite, including equity curves, drawdown charts, and metrics like the Sharpe & Sortino Ratios.
*   **Complete Trading Ecosystem:** Analyze charts with TradingView, get AI-powered insights from the "Strategy Sensei" (GPT-4), manage a custodial wallet, and execute manual trades directly from an integrated terminal.
*   **Community-Powered Marketplace:** New users can subscribe to profitable, proven strategies from top traders. Creators are incentivized to build and share, creating a powerful growth loop.
*   **Cross-Platform Accessibility:** Manage your portfolio and monitor bots on the web or on the go with the fully-featured React Native mobile application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started: Local Setup

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.10+, Node.js 16+, Docker (optional but recommended)
*   A Firebase project for authentication.
*   API keys for services listed in `.env.example` (OpenAI, payment gateways, etc.).
*   A configured VPN is **highly recommended** to avoid network blocks from ISPs.

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create your .env file from the example and fill in your keys
cp .env.example .env
nano .env # or use any text editor

# Train the AI model (requires a working network connection)
python train_model.py

# Run the backend server
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 2. Frontend (Web) Setup
```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory from the root
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create your .env file and add your Firebase client config
cp .env.example .env
nano .env

# Run the frontend development server
npm start
```

### 3. Frontend (Mobile) Setup
```bash
# Navigate to the mobile directory from the root
cd QuantumLeapMobile

# Install dependencies
npm install

# IMPORTANT: Update the backend IP address in src/api/axiosInstance.js
# Replace 'YOUR_BACKEND_IP' with your computer's local IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

# Run the mobile app using Expo Go
npx expo start
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Advanced Future Roadmap
